# EEG-Signal-Analysis-and-Granger-Causality-Software

Developed Matlab software for EEG signal analysis, focusing on the extraction of signal features such as energy and applying Granger causality bidirectionally between electrodes to study brain activity. The software allows for the prediction of signal energy using Granger causality and provides both qualitative and quantitative insights into EEG signals. A Graphical User Interface (GUI) was implemented to make the tool accessible for users without programming skills, enabling them to modify analysis parameters and explore different outcomes from the EEG data analyses.
